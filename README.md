# indexer-reader-clj

A Clojure wrapper for the maven-indexer-reader project.

## Usage

The `ReadableRes` protocol is used for accessing remote index files. A default implementation for the `URI` type is added.

The `WritableRes` protocol is used to save the state of the indexer.

The following example prints out all the artifacts from Clojars.

```
(def clojars-root (new java.net.URI "http://repo.clojars.org/.index/"))

(doseq [chunk (index-reader clojars-root nil)]
  (println :name (.getName chunk))
  (doseq [record chunk]
    (println (map-record record))))
```
